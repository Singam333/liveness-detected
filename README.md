Face Extractor contains the code that is capable of extracting images fro a video which is taken using your webcam using opencv
if already a video is present you can give directly that video as input instead of recording again.
Two times it is repeated once with your original face and other time with your digital or photocopy face and images are extracted from it using that code.
